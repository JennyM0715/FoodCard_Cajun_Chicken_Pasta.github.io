# Food Card
    Cajun Chicken Pasta food card. The dish is based off from Chili's Cajun Chicken Pasta using only HTML and CSS.
    A JS file was created which contains one line of code which basically is suppose to automatically update the CopyRight year---this is pureply for practice. I don't own the image, this is just to practice makign a food card.
